# Anime.js_first_visualisation

Honestly, that's my very very first web project where I just tried basics of html, css and JavaScript

---

## In that project I used:
 + HTML basics
 + Simple CSS styles
 + Trivial Js
 + JS animations
 + Anime.js (JS animation library)

---

And that's probably it...

### Here's a picture of the project:

P.S. I know that it's totally broken on phones, but I'm OK with it. I didn't thought about it while creating a project. I was just learning the fundamentals.

P.P.S In the future that project and repo will be deleted. But by now it's just a memory to remember from what I've started.
